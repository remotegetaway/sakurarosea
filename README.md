## Why dual license?
Sakura Rosea is distributed under both an All Rights Reserved license for assets, and an LGPL license for code. We believe in supporting the wider modding community. Many modders use code examples to help them learn how to work with Minecraft and the mod loader they've chosen - while our code may not be of an absolutely professional quality, we hope that its availability helps someone else with their own modding work.

To that end, feel free to look over our code for examples of how we've solved the problems we encountered while writing this mod, incorporate snippets into your own, or even backport it - just remember that our asset specific license means that you can't take any of the models or textures for your own projects.

We reserve the right to enforce our copyright - via the DMCA (or other country-relevant legislation), acquisition of teeth, or sacrifice in our weekly demonic ritual.

This software is provided as-is, without any kind of warranty. While we do our best to avoid serious bugs, we take no responsibility for our mods pouring glue in your keyboard, deleting System32, turning your Roomba into a soul sucking demon, or any other possible negative effects.
